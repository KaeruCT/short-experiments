please write the necessary html and javascript code to implement this game:

the player controls a robot vacuum. the objective is to clean the floor before time runs out.
the player has 60 seconds to clean the floor completely.
there is a timer on the top left of the screen displaying how much time is left, for example: "Time left: 16.3s". Render the timer within an HTML element.
the floor is represented by a 2d array of 8x8 and rendered on the screen using html canvas.
each tile should be rendered as a  16x16px square.
ensure the html canvas size is big enough to fit all the rendered squares.

the floor is white, the vacuum is rendered as a blue circle and light blue circle inside.
random positions within the floor will contain dust (called dust value), represented by an integer from 0 to 3. 0 means it is clean, 3 means it is filthy.
this value also affects the color of the tile. the dirtier it is, the darker it will appear.
the player controls the vacuum by pressing the arrows keys.
the player can reduce the dust value by moving the vacuum to the correct position in the world.

once the dust value is 0 for all the tiles, the game is over, the player has won.
if the time runs out, the game is over, the player has lost.
when the game is over, show a button that the player can click to play again.

make it so the vacuum can only move once per 250milliseconds

instead of squares for the tiles, render each tile as random pixels so it looks more like dust
